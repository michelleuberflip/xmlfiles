Check out our Email Geek Gift Guide!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Editor’s note: None of these links are affiliate links. The idea of this guide is to support email geeks who are makers and spread some holiday joy!</span><b></b></p>
<h2><b>For the cleverest of email geeks</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first pick for our Email Geek Gift Guide is probably no surprise to most die-hard email geeks out there. We’d be happy to be gifted just about anything from Najmah Salam’s </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/najmetender"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Etsy shop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Najmah’s shop has a great mix of </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/najmetender?section_id=33559585"><span style="font-weight: 400;">t-shirts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/najmetender?section_id=34293152"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mugs</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/najmetender?section_id=28102872"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stickers.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whether you’re shopping for a geek who likes to wear their sarcasm on their sleeve; a coffee-connoisseur; or a sticker-fiend who covers every inch of their laptop or water bottle with their favorite iconography, you’re sure to find the perfect gift!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Sparkpost, we’re loving the </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1017315628/email-geek-mug-with-color-inside?ref=shop_home_active_7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Email Geek”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> design and the </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1020172889/bitchin-interactive-email-build-sticker?ref=shop_home_active_18"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1980s inspired production-related design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> definitely made us giggle in the very best way. </span></p>
<h2><b>For the email geek whose boss said email was dead</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email geeks are notorious for their love of stickers and the stickers from Carin Slater’s </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/EmailIsDead"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Etsy shop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would be great additions to any collection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These fun designs give a dubious nod to the many times we’ve been told that email is dead. We love the idea of giving that email geek who’s crushing it in their role the “Email’s Dead, I Killed It” </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1063802917/email-is-dead-i-killed-it-sticker?ref=shop_home_active_2&amp;frs=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sticker</span></a>.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Let them know you’re cheering them on in their success!</span></p>
<h2><b>For the snarkier variety of email geek</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proprietor of the </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/EllucyStitches"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EllucyStitches Etsy shop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn’t an email geek (that we know of, anyway) but she does have some fun options in her shop with email appeal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her “Per my last email” </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/687845831/per-my-last-email-full-kit-hand?ref=shop_home_feat_3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">embroidery kit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/738942138/pens-per-my-last-email-3-pack-sleek?ref=shop_home_active_13&amp;crt=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pens</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/682244038/sticker-per-my-last-email-sticker-vinyl?ref=shop_home_active_24"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stickers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would be perfect gifts for the snarkiest of email marketers on your list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And who hasn’t had a day when the </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/673334823/nope-full-kit-hand-embroidery-kit?ref=shop_home_active_17&amp;crt=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nope”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/603715673/digital-hand-embroidery-pattern-floral?ref=shop_home_active_20&amp;crt=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designs wouldn’t sum it up perfectly? Full disclosure: depending on your workplace, some of the designs in this shop are NSFW.</span></p>
<h2><b>For the sweeter email geek</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to support a fellow email geek and aren’t necessarily worried about giving in an email theme, this </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/shopmadebymar"><span style="font-weight: 400;">next shop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is for you. Email geek Marissa Michele’s designs will make anyone on your list this season, smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a friend celebrating a milestone like an engagement or wedding, we love her custom </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/shopmadebymar?section_id=35165369"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wine bottle labels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Her </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/shopmadebymar?section_id=30643341"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mirror decals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are also a great way to give anyone (or even yourself!) a daily pep-talk.</span></p>
<h2><b>For the punny email geek</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.emailloot.com/">Email Loot</a> is an email geek-run treasure trove of merchandise featuring email puns. Anne Tomlin’s shop features t-shirts, mugs, and stickers, giving you plenty of options for finding the perfect gift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of our favorites here:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.emailloot.com/collections/mug-collection/products/i-didn-t-choose-email-email-chose-me-2">mug</a> with the relatable phrase, “I Didn’t Choose Email; Email Chose Me”</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.emailloot.com/products/if-statement"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If Statement” t-shirt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is perfect for the marketing ops guru in your life</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You also can’t go wrong with anything featuring </span><a href="https://www.emailloot.com/collections/most-popular/products/eunice-the-email-unicorn"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eunice the Email Unicorn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.emailloot.com/collections/most-popular/products/dolphin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">​​Delfina, Finley, &amp; Josefina, the Email Dolphins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or </span><a href="https://www.emailloot.com/collections/most-popular/products/travis-the-email-owl"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travis the Email Owl</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>For all of us</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last entry in our gift guide, we picked an option that&#8217;s not specifically related to email, or email geek-owned. We hope you&#8217;ll forgive us because</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/GoatsandTotes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goats and Totes</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is filled with the kind of vibes we&#8217;d like to take into 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We love the </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/611392544/doing-my-best-motivational-keyring?ref=shop_home_active_19&amp;crt=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Doing my best” keychain</span></a> and<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/874138048/the-sun-will-rise-we-will-try-again-hard?ref=shop_home_feat_1">“​​The Sun Will Rise + We Will Try Again” pin</a>. The </span><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/702650256/5-pack-motivational-postcards?ref=shop_home_active_2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pack of postcards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is sure to put a smile on any recipient&#8217;s face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have a favorite email geek maker we didn’t include on the list! If so, <a href="https://twitter.com/SparkPost">tweet us</a> and share the details! We’d love to include them in a future guide and share the love.</span></p>

<p>In thinking about what we’re thankful for, it’s not hard to list the positive attributes of the email community and email as a communication channel in general. Here’s a look at why we’re thankful to be #emailgeeks</p>
<h2>Passion and energy</h2>
<p>I am incredibly grateful for the email community. It&#8217;s crazy to think about, but the majority of my adult life has been devoted to helping companies send better email and the entire ecosystem that is represented in email.</p>
<p>I am especially grateful for our SparkPost team and our <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/case-studies/">awesome customers</a> that I get the privilege to partner with on a daily basis. The energy and passion that we all share for this particular communication channel are unparalleled.</p>
<p>And finally, I’m thankful for all the email marketers who will be tirelessly working to ensure that personalized and, just as importantly, relevant, promotional offers make it to my inbox over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>~ Chris Adams, Distinguished Engineer &amp; Evangelist</p>
<h2>A long and meaningful career</h2>
<p>I’m very grateful to the email itself and the email community as a whole, which has enabled me to build a career and a successful business spanning more than two decades.</p>
<p>The email community is special for how deeply it cares about the long-term health of the ecosystem, which I think is exemplified by how many people have built careers around making email better.</p>
<p>I’m grateful to the amazing people I work with here every day, whose energy, intelligence, and kindness make it a pleasure to get up and sign in to work every day. I feel incredibly lucky to be surrounded by such passion and talent.</p>
<p>And I am grateful to our customers who have not only supported the growth of the business but been amazing and often challenging partners, helping drive us to build better products.</p>
<p>~ George Schlossnagle, Distinguished Engineer &amp; Evangelist</p>
<h2>Unsung heroes of marketing</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m thankful for the world&#8217;s email teams. On the whole, email geeks are super hard working and do a lot of complex work and are often the unsung heroes of marketing.</p>
<p>~ Elliot Ross, Taxi for Email Founder &amp; Evangelist</p>
<p>(Editor’s note and humblebrag: <a href="https://www.taxiforemail.com/">Taxi for Email</a> helps them achieve <em>even more</em>!)</p>
<h2>An amazing evolution</h2>
<p>I’m so thankful for email.</p>
<p>Who’d have thought that a neat bit of code <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/a-look-back-at-50-years-of-email/">more than 50 years ago</a> would blossom into this elegant infrastructure that is used by billions of people around the world every day, but which doesn’t belong to one company?</p>
<p>It’s been a part of my life since my first email account 25 years ago, and I can’t imagine a day without it now!</p>
<p>~ Kieran Cooper, SparkPost Technical Account Manager</p>
<h2>Empowerment and inclusiveness</h2>
<p>I am thankful that the email community and SparkPost approach our channel and profession with a mind toward being inclusive, diverse, and embracing humanity.</p>
<p>In recent years, we’ve seen more women and minorities represented more publicly in our space as conference presenters and published authors (bylines AND books!). We see more of a push for accessibility, so everyone can engage with the emails the collective we work so hard to produce. We see more conversations about tackling burnout that seems pervasive in email (because email is hard!).</p>
<p>We&#8217;re starting to see better email messages in our inboxes because #emailgeeks are now empowered to send emails that treat their customers like the people they are. We&#8217;re seeing language changes in the email products we use to eliminate classic norms that are harmful to minorities. (i.e. blacklist is now blocklist.)</p>
<p>My heart is thankful to see the industry evolve in ways that seemed impossible even five years ago. Yes, we still have work to do, but we have made some huge strides.</p>
<p>~ April Mullen, Director of Brand &amp; Content</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the healthiest sender occasionally ends up on a blocklist. This can create a lot of confusion since it’s often not clear which mailbox providers are using which blocklist and what is the resulting impact on </span><a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/email-deliverability-crash-course/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deliverability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and inbox placement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SparkPost&#8217;s Deliverability Analytics Blocklist Impact feature works to address the confusion by quantifying the impact, tailored to your unique recipients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We love data here at SparkPost, and we love sharing how we make your data work better for you. So, we wanted to pull back the curtain and show how we developed this great new feature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll discuss how we used the depth and breadth of data unique to Sparkpost to create a simple yet powerful tool. We wrote the first part of this blog post with a general audience in mind. We&#8217;ll get into the technical details, for all the math geeks out there, in the second part of the post.</span></p>
<h2><b>Part 1: What the heck is Blocklist Impact?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many senders don’t think about blocklists too much until they learn they landed on one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blocklists are the virtual informants of the email world, while mailbox providers are the virtual police – taking action on information from the informants. It’s ultimately up to the mailbox providers to determine which informants to listen to and how they choose to act. Examples of blocklists include Spamhaus, Cloudmark Sender Intelligence (CSI), and Spamcop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some typical actions we see mailbox providers take when an IP or sending domain is blocklisted include putting emails from that IP/sending domain in the spam folder, delaying the email, or even just bouncing the email altogether. However, not all blocklists are created equal! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are thousands of blocklists. Most will have no impact on your sending. A very select few are used by a combination of mailbox providers where the impact is likely to be significant (Spamhaus). And of course, there are some blocklists in the “gray area,” that may or may not impact your sending depending on which providers make up your list. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without understanding the impact of a blocklist on your specific list, you can spend hours or days trying to resolve a blocklisting that has no material effect on your sending, while simultaneously missing a blocklisting that will have a major impact. We built SparkPost&#8217;s Deliverability Analytics Blocklist Impact feature to address this exact problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So – the first step is to determine which mailbox providers are using which lists and the impact we should expect. Unfortunately, we can’t just call and ask – so let’s use the next best thing – data! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the major blocklist providers will confirm when IP addresses are put on their blocklist and when it is removed. Knowing when an IP address is blocklisted is a start, but that’s not going to tell us the impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where we leverage our unique volume of data. We can study the deliverability metrics for IP addresses when blocklisted for each mailbox provider (we track over 200!). We then compare those metrics for IP addresses when </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blocklisted and determine if there is a statistically significant material difference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The volume of data needed to separate the noise when looking across key metrics, at infrequent events (blocklisting), for over 200 mailbox providers is enormous. We use </span><b>billions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of data points to complete this task and refresh every 6 months to keep up with changes in the landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a technical explanation, please read the second part of this post but in the meantime, here is the tl;dr of the details. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We first start by grouping our data into hourly intervals. For each IP address, we aggregate the volume of bounces, delays, engagement events (opens + clicks), and injections. We use engagement as a proxy since we don’t always know if an email is delivered to the spam folder. Observations with insufficient data are excluded from the model. Below is a mock of how the data appears at this point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62907" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-1.png" alt="Sample deliverability metrics for IP addresses when blocklisted" width="885" height="129" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-1.png 885w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-1.png?resize=300,44 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-1.png?resize=768,112 768w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-1.png?resize=100,15 100w" sizes="(max-width: 885px) 100vw, 885px" /> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step in the process is to begin looking at each of the blocklists. For a given blocklist – we look at each mailbox provider and classify each observation as blocklisted or non-blocklisted. Below is a mock of the data at this next point.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62908" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-2.png" alt="Sample deliverability metrics for IP addresses when blocklisted" width="890" height="168" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-2.png 890w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-2.png?resize=300,57 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-2.png?resize=768,145 768w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-2.png?resize=100,19 100w" sizes="(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For each blocklist-mailbox provider combination, we now have two rich datasets with the aforementioned three key metrics – one dataset aggregating observations when actively on the blocklist and the control dataset – aggregating observations when </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> actively on the blocklist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In cases where a mailbox provider performs an action, such as block bouncing, to IP addresses actively listed on the given blocklist, we would expect to see a material difference in the bounce rates between the two datasets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, we would not expect to see a material difference when the blocklist is not being used. Noise and unrelated factors may still produce differences; hence we apply mathematical techniques, detailed in the second part of this blog, to control for extraneous effects.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62909" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-3.png" alt="Graph showing distribution of bounce rate for Mailbox Provider X" width="1024" height="421" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-3.png 1086w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-3.png?resize=300,123 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-3.png?resize=768,315 768w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-3.png?resize=1024,421 1024w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-3.png?resize=100,41 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this real example, where we masked the blocklist and mailbox provider, we can see a clear pattern with the bounce rate for the mailbox provider typically in the single digits when not listed on the blocklist, but close to 100% when listed 70% of the time. This provides strong evidence that this mailbox provider uses the example blocklist.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62910" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-4.png" alt="Graph showing distribution of bounce rate for Mailbox Provider Y" width="1024" height="421" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-4.png 1086w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-4.png?resize=300,123 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-4.png?resize=768,315 768w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-4.png?resize=1024,421 1024w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-4.png?resize=100,41 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, in this example, the bounce rate is in the single digits close to 100% of the time whether or not an IP address is on the given blocklist, providing strong evidence that the mailbox provider does </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use this blocklist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For each combination, we quantify how different the two distributions are into a single index – the details are in the second part of this blog for those interested. What’s important is the larger the number, the more different the two distributions are, hence the more likely it is that the mailbox provider uses the blocklist to take an action (in this example, block bounces). For completely identical distributions, this value is zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with our team of deliverability experts, we analyzed a spectrum of index values to determine appropriate cutoffs for our 3 categories: unlikely, possible, and likely. We also have a category for insufficient data. When a sender is placed on a blocklist, we take a weighted average of their unique distribution of recipients’ mailbox providers to communicate the overall impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had enough math and can’t wait to give SparkPost&#8217;s Deliverability Analytics Blocklist Impact feature a try? </span><a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/deliverability-analytics-get-a-demo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get in touch with us</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a demo today!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eat math for breakfast and ready for more? Keep on reading for all the glorious numerical details.</span></p>
<h2><b>Part 2: Math Geekery</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In part 2 of this post, we will describe the technical details for how we calculate the blocklist impact index (BII). In this explanation, we will only talk about estimating the effects of block bounces. However, the identical routine is performed for delays and spam foldering (using engagement as a proxy for the latter).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a given mailbox provider-blocklist combination, we need to estimate both the distribution of bounces for IP addresses when blocklisted (the test distribution) and the distribution for non-blocklisted (the control distribution). We call </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">F</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sub>0</sub></span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(x)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the latter and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">F</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sub>1</sub></span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(x)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the former. We will use traditional notation where capital </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">F</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> represents the cumulative distribution function (cdf) and small </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">f</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to represent the probability mass function (pmf).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall the table in part 1. We use the columns: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bounces</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">injections</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bounce rate</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to derive the distributions. The right-most column, Blocklist X facets the data into two sets. We discretize our data by aggregating bounce rate into intervals of length 0.01 over the interval [0, 1], i.e. 0.00-0.01, 0.01-0.02 etc.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62911" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-5.png" alt="Sample deliverability metrics for IP addresses when blocklisted" width="890" height="168" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-5.png 890w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-5.png?resize=300,57 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-5.png?resize=768,145 768w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Blog-Image-5.png?resize=100,19 100w" sizes="(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s define the following:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">x</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the lowerbound of the interval (e.g. 0.00 for 0.00-0.01)</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">b</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sub>j</sub></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: bounce rate for observation j</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sub>x</sub></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: total injections over the given interval</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sub>T</sub></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: total injections over the entire distribution</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We then estimate </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">f(x)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as follows:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\text{For&amp;space;x&amp;space;in&amp;space;[0,&amp;space;0.99]:&amp;space;}&amp;space;\widehat{f(x)}=\sum\frac{i_x|x&amp;space;&lt;&amp;space;b_j&amp;space;\leq&amp;space;x+0.01}{i_T}." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img title="\text{For x in [0, 0.99]: } \widehat{f(x)}=\sum\frac{i_x|x &lt; b_j \leq x+0.01}{i_T}." src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\text{For&amp;space;x&amp;space;in&amp;space;[0,&amp;space;0.99]:&amp;space;}&amp;space;\widehat{f(x)}=\sum\frac{i_x|x&amp;space;&lt;&amp;space;b_j&amp;space;\leq&amp;space;x+0.01}{i_T}." /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do include bounce rate=0 in the first interval. In other words, we use the estimate for the pmf as the sum of injections for all bounce rates in the interval over the total injections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have an estimate for the two distributions, we need to quantify the disparity. The objective is to derive an index that behaves like a penalty with the following features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero when the distributions are identical</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increases when the test distribution (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">f</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sub>1</sub></span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(x)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is greater than the control (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">f</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sub>0</sub></span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(x)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) for more adverse values (e.g. higher bounce rates)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does not increase when the test distribution (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">f</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sub>1</sub></span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(x)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is greater than the control (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">f</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sub>0</sub></span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(x)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) for favorable values (e.g. lower bounce rates)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We begin with the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kullback–Leibler divergence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sup>1</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, generally used in machine learning and information theory.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=D_{KL}&amp;space;=&amp;space;\sum&amp;space;_{x\in&amp;space;{\mathcal&amp;space;{X}}}f_1(x)&amp;space;ln&amp;space;\left(&amp;space;\frac{&amp;space;f_1(x)}{&amp;space;f_0(x)}&amp;space;\right)." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img title="D_{KL} = \sum _{x\in {\mathcal {X}}}f_1(x) ln \left( \frac{ f_1(x)}{ f_0(x)} \right)." src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?D_{KL}&amp;space;=&amp;space;\sum&amp;space;_{x\in&amp;space;{\mathcal&amp;space;{X}}}f_1(x)&amp;space;ln&amp;space;\left(&amp;space;\frac{&amp;space;f_1(x)}{&amp;space;f_0(x)}&amp;space;\right)." /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Above is the standard Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL div) formula, substituting the typical P and Q for the notation </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">f</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sub>0</sub></span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(x)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">f</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sub>1</sub></span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(x)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we are using. This formula is the weighted average of the ratio of the pmf’s over each point in the domain. This does give us the properties:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero when the distributions are identical</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increases when the test distribution (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">f</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sub>1</sub></span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(x)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) is greater than the control (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">f</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sub>0</sub></span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(x)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it does not increase for more adverse values (higher bounce rates) and is applied equivalently when the test pmf distribution is more favorable (lower bounce rate). Therefore, we will modify the formula to produce the required properties. For example, in the case shown below, due to randomness a large pmf for the test distribution is at 0% pmf – which would produce a sizable KL div when clearly the mailbox provider does not use the blocklist to bounce sending IP’s.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62926" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Impact-Image.png" alt="" width="1024" height="421" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Impact-Image.png 1086w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Impact-Image.png?resize=300,123 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Impact-Image.png?resize=768,315 768w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Impact-Image.png?resize=1024,421 1024w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blocklist-Impact-Image.png?resize=100,41 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First let’s introduce two more notations, the median of the control (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">F</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sub>0</sub></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and an indicator function:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">m</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: solution to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">F</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sub>0</sub></span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(m)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> = 0.5</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=I_m&amp;space;=&amp;space;\begin{cases}&amp;space;1,&amp;space;&amp;&amp;space;\text{if&amp;space;x&amp;space;$&gt;$&amp;space;m}&amp;space;\\\\&amp;space;0,&amp;space;&amp;&amp;space;\text{otherwise}&amp;space;\end{cases}" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img title="I_m = \begin{cases} 1, &amp; \text{if x $&gt;$ m} \\\\ 0, &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?I_m&amp;space;=&amp;space;\begin{cases}&amp;space;1,&amp;space;&amp;&amp;space;\text{if&amp;space;x&amp;space;$&gt;$&amp;space;m}&amp;space;\\\\&amp;space;0,&amp;space;&amp;&amp;space;\text{otherwise}&amp;space;\end{cases}" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">where m can be estimated using interpolation methods. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sub>A</sub></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is simply the indicator function that allows us to ignore values below the median value of the control distribution. For cases where lower values are adverse (e.g. engagement, the proxy for spam foldering), we simply switch the sign in the indicator function. We can now modify the KL div to produce the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blocklist Impact Index (BII)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=BII&amp;space;=&amp;space;max(\sum&amp;space;_{x\in&amp;space;{\mathcal&amp;space;{X}}}|x-m|f_1(x)&amp;space;ln&amp;space;\left(&amp;space;\frac{&amp;space;f_1(x)}{&amp;space;f_0(x)}&amp;space;\right)I_m,&amp;space;0)." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img title="BII = max(\sum _{x\in {\mathcal {X}}}|x-m|f_1(x) ln \left( \frac{ f_1(x)}{ f_0(x)} \right)I_m, 0)." src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?BII&amp;space;=&amp;space;max(\sum&amp;space;_{x\in&amp;space;{\mathcal&amp;space;{X}}}|x-m|f_1(x)&amp;space;ln&amp;space;\left(&amp;space;\frac{&amp;space;f_1(x)}{&amp;space;f_0(x)}&amp;space;\right)I_m,&amp;space;0)." /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three modifications are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">|x-m|</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> applies greater weight for more adverse events, which becomes particularly useful in our case where the control distribution is typically tightly centered around the median</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indicator function, which allows the BII to ignore favorable values in the test distribution that arises due to randomness</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flooring the index at 0, which occurs for some edge cases due to the two other modifications</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BII is the final form that we now use to determine how likely it is that a mailbox producer uses a blocklist for a given action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOW have we sated your appetite for equations? We’d love to show you SparkPost&#8217;s Deliverability Analytics Blocklist Impact feature in action. </span><a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/deliverability-analytics-get-a-demo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a live demo. </span></p>

You’re not alone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an industry-wide issue that Microsoft is aware of and is actively working on a resolution, but the fix may take some time. While they have indicated that senders should not see an impact on their reputation, we cannot rule out that some individual senders might see a drop in their inbox placement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue became initially noticeable on August 11, 2021, where complaints jumped by over 150% overnight and then jumped again in early October. Across all of our SparkPost senders, we have seen the number of complaints increase by over 450% compared to what they were on August 10th.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62743" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Microsoft-Complaints-over-Time.png" alt="Chart showing a rise in Microsoft complaints" width="1024" height="501" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Microsoft-Complaints-over-Time.png 1398w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Microsoft-Complaints-over-Time.png?resize=300,147 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Microsoft-Complaints-over-Time.png?resize=768,376 768w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Microsoft-Complaints-over-Time.png?resize=1024,501 1024w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Microsoft-Complaints-over-Time.png?resize=1200,587 1200w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Microsoft-Complaints-over-Time.png?resize=100,49 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are actively working with Microsoft to more fully understand what the root cause of this issue is and when a resolution will be available. If you are a SparkPost sender and believe your inbox placement has seen a recent hit at Microsoft properties, please open a support ticket. Our deliverability teams can investigate, and, as warranted, open a remediation ticket with Microsoft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll make updates to this post as we know more. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next phase of our partnership with Salesforce Marketing Cloud is here – and if you’re an email marketer with too much to do and not enough time, it’s going to be a game-changer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatic seeding enables marketers and deliverability specialists to efficiently gauge real-time email performance within the Salesforce Marketing Cloud platform, right where you’re already executing your email programs. The tightly integrated solution leverages deliverability, engagement, and conversion data to surface insights. Plus, you can leverage automation to improve campaign performance in real-time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following our announcement that </span><a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/sparkpost-integration-salesforce-journey-builder/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SparkPost’s Inbox Tracker is fully integrated with Salesforce Journey Builder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this summer, it’s been great to collaborate once again to bring world-class email marketing technology to our customers. </span></p>
<h2><b>Stop losing revenue to the spam folder.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the world’s largest email optimization platform sending nearly 40% of the world’s email, SparkPost is well acquainted with the common pains of an email marketer – and we’re determined to help you win in the inbox. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re typically swamped with driving engagement and demand for your brand, you’ll likely agree that manually seeding emails is the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">last</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thing you want to worry about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out some benefits of Inbox Tracker’s automatic seeding capabilities:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s fully integrated and unlimited, so campaigns sent through Email Studio and Automation Studio can be – you guessed it – </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seeded. This helps give you an accurate and complete picture of email performance, without having to bounce between platforms.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can easily leverage SparkPost’s AI-driven Intelliseeds™, which model real human behavior, to get a true understanding of how audiences engage with email content. Spotting problem areas and making adjustments to improve deliverability are easier, in turn improving the bottom line. You’ll have the ability to customize inbox placement tests according to campaign-specific needs, including geographies, seeding thresholds, and types of seeds to use. </span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What, do you write to it? Like mail?!&#8221; – Bryant Gumbel</span></p>
<h2><b>50 years of Email</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifty years ago, in October 1971, MIT graduate </span><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/07/email-ray-tomlinson-history__;!!CQl3mcHX2A!VE0w7hGraOJRQXBvhSZod4oJwehcMmWFEpEerDofH-G5T8yK3XvpBRR0V8WNYEitfnjz$"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ray Tomlinson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sent the very first email. In fact, Tomlinson introduced the concept of the ‘@’ symbol to identify a message recipient on a remote computer system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In those days, multiple users often shared computers. Tomlinson was working on a piece of software called SNDMSG, allowing people to send messages to others using the same computer.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating email was a side project for Tomlinson and when he showed email to another employee for the first time, he reportedly said: “Don’t tell anyone! This isn’t what we’re supposed to be working on.” According to Tomlinson, the first email was “something like QWERTYUIOP.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several years later, in 1978, Gary Thuerk sent the world&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/the-history-of-spam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first email marketing message</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to 400 people. It produced $13 million in computer equipment sales. </span></p>
<h2><b>Growing Pains</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year SparkPost’s Founder and Chief Evangelist, George Schlossnagle, </span><a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/resources/video-content/email-duh-laura-atkins-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chatted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauraatkins/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura Atkins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Deliverability Consultant and Owner of the Word to the Wise, about the deliverability career path as well as her insider take on getting into the inbox. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conversation naturally evolved into a discussion about email in the mid-1990s and early 2000s, when many were just starting to seriously consider the communication channel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My earliest memories of being a professional with an email address – email was a little bit of a hellscape,” said Schlossnagle, who entered the email world in the late 1990s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then, before the days of spam filters, Schlossnagle recalls how inboxes were generally 80 percent junk. Gaining control of your inbox at that time was virtually impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Atkins, as email – and the way we use it – has matured, the possibilities are pure magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The idea that you have a lot of control, and you can send pictures and you can send videos and you can send communications – but you can also receive. You can receive tickets to a play … you can get things of value in your inbox,” explained Atkins.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that I can go up to a website and I can type up my email address and sign up and I can get tickets to an open mic night at a Comedy Club here in Dublin. It’s like, that’s just magic.”</span></p>
<h2><b>What’s Next</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve come a long way from the QWERTYUIOP days. Currently, there are 3.8 billion email users who send almost 300 billion emails daily. SparkPost sends 40% of those messages!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While industry pundits have been predicting the death of email for years, it’s still alive and well – but with new and continuing challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As SparkPost’s Director of Brand and Content Marketing April Mullen predicted in our </span><a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/resources/white-papers-guides/2021-email-predictions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 </span></a><a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/resources/white-papers-guides/2021-email-predictions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email Predictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the sunsetting of third-party cookies is causing marketers to value the most powerful first-party asset, email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’ll continue to see in 2021 and beyond is the end of the advertising industrial complex where brands repeatedly re-acquire customers instead of focusing on a more cost-effective retention strategy,” Mullen said. “Retention, and therefore email, will take its rightful place in getting the budget it needs to be done well because re-acquisition is only going to get harder and more expensive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, the email world has been buzzing about Apple’s Mail Privacy Protection for their Mail app on iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey devices. The MPP rollout took place in late September and is expected to reach 100% in late 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re curious about how MPP will impact your email program, join us on November 16 for </span><a href="https://events.sparkpost.com/ama-ios15?src=Blog&amp;pc=bl-wbn-ios15-impact&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=sp-website&amp;utm_campaign=WBN-2021-11-16-ios15-impact&amp;utm_content=50years"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ask Us Anything: The Impact of iOS 15 on Email Opens.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While changes like MPP and the sunset of third-party cookies can be hard to predict, the #emailgeeks at SparkPost will continue to serve as a voice for the email community – whatever comes our way during the next 50 years of email and beyond!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How would you feel if you joined a new company and discovered that the use of Slack was limited to work-related conversation?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I joined SparkPost in August, it was quickly apparent that wouldn’t be the case. I was immediately welcomed to the team and directed to the channels for #pet-lovers, #bakers, #foodies, and #gardeners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was clear that SparkPost builds its </span><a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/careers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remote-first culture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using Slack, and it truly creates camaraderie around shared hobbies and interests – and I was here for it.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/ix6wrihsgNwdXKVBjy" width="480" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I was working hundreds of miles away from most of my coworkers, I was able to quickly connect with plenty of folks I had more in common with than just being a fellow colleague.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I did hear from a past colleague recently who joined a new company only to discover that Slack was very, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">well</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, quiet there.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/l1ugrx6wml2ooQik0" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was wondering if that should be a red flag, and I had to admit that for me it would be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a remote-first company, Slack has become the primary way SparkPost employees communicate. That extends to the types of conversations you might typically save for the breakroom or that random hallway chat. I would guess it’s likely the same way for most remote organizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, back in 2019 </span><a href="https://slack.com/blog/news/slack-has-10-million-daily-active-users"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slack reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that more than 10 million people used the platform daily. It’s easy to imagine that with so many companies going remote during the pandemic that the number is now much higher.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/Lcn0yF1RcLANG" width="480" height="361" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at SparkPost, we have many channels dedicated to everything you’d expect, like customer support and team collaboration, along with more unexpected topics like gardening, TV, and raising kids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon looking into the analytics on the internal Slack usage, it’s clear that those “fun” channels are appreciated as part of SparkPost’s company culture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top three channels when ranked by the number of messages sent are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#randomactsofkarma &#8211; A channel dedicated to giving “karma points” to coworkers when they go above and beyond</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#askusanything &#8211; A channel for posing questions to the </span><a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/leadership-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Management Team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at SparkPost</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">#sparkpostlife &#8211; A channel where folks often post what’s going on in their lives, from vacation pictures to team meet-ups</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SparkPost started using Slack for internal messaging in 2016, and in that time we’ve sent more than 13 million messages as an organization! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so much messaging going on, we wanted to see what team members consider their favorite Slack channels for conversation. Here’s a look at some of the responses we received.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it can often also be a red flag when businesses refer to colleagues as a “family,” like it or not, we </span><b><i>are </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">often connected with our coworkers for most of the day, most days of the week. I probably appreciate it more than some as an extrovert, but spending that time talking about nothing but work sounds like torture to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think I’m alone, either. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When my colleague Sasha Malcolmson shared her favorite Slack channel with me, she was quick to add, “We&#8217;re a group of real humans working together for a common goal. I&#8217;m really pleased and also proud that my company is encouraging these types of Slack channels.”</span></p>

Being in an office setting, then coming back home to relax and possibly spend time with your children/spouse has all changed in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a college student, taking a full class load, interning, and still having a social life has drastically changed for me as well. Throughout my time as the Marketing Intern, I have faced challenges to find time for myself and focus on my well-being. However, with these few simple steps, I have been able to balance everything and stay motivated.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 1: Listen to your body</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are the only one that truly knows how you feel. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need a break from staring at your computer screen, get up and walk around your house or take a little stroll outside. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are getting so overwhelmed with a certain task, take a break and come back to it later in the day with a fresh set of eyes. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting for long periods of time can create different aches and pains, so get up every so often, move your feet and stretch out.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 2: Do not overwork yourself </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are human.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one expects you to be working 24 hours 7 days a week</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not check your email before or after work hours (they won’t magically disappear)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schedule time in your day to do one thing you really enjoy (I have been working out, baking, and cooking daily)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 3: Switch up your routine</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move around!</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work outside if it’s a nice day! </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Change up your work setting to have something new and refreshing! </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Print a photo of a place you love, and look at it when you are having a hard day.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do a fun workout (dance class? Spin class? Run? Jam out to music?) </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some ways that I have implemented these steps include: every fews hours I try to listen to music and walk around to get up and stretch out, I try to stick to schedules so anytime before ~8am and after ~5:30pm I limit any intern work and just focus on school work, I take at least an hour every day to do some type workout or workout class, I also change up where I work daily by sometimes working by the lake or in one of my favorite buildings on campus. These three simple steps have kept me sane throughout the pandemic and have allowed me to find the balance between interning, being a student, and spending time with my friends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have an interesting perspective as a student, so I asked my colleagues to give me some tips they have for balancing work and life. </span></p>
<p><b>April Mullen &#8211; Director of Brand and Content Marketing</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a dedicated space for work if you can. Having a door I can close behind me each day is powerful in helping me to switch off for the day. It clearly helps my brain know where I can relax in my home and where I need to be productive. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be afraid to take short breaks when working from home. If you were in an office, you’d think nothing about chatting with a colleague in the break room for 15 minutes. Do the same at home. For me, it might be a short walk or playing catch in my yard with my dogs. Sometimes meetings can be an opportunity to layer in this recommendation. Take “walking meetings” where you walk and have a chat with a colleague. It helps to get away from sitting at a desk all day. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take care of yourself! Make it a point to exercise, drink water and fuel your body with nutrition that will give it energy. It’s easy for energy to dip when working from home, so I’ve found that staying on top of those three things has dramatically improved my energy and endurance for long work days within my home. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Matthew Parsloe &#8211; Marketing Manager at Taxi for Email</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be regimented with your time if you&#8217;re working from home. It&#8217;s easy to slip into a habit of doing an extra hour or two of work each day because the commute time isn&#8217;t there anymore, or you just want to finish that bit of work. But it all adds up and can overwhelm the time you need to unwind, which can impact your overall mental health and cause stress. Having set start and stop times can help you break up work and home life and give you the space you need to stay mentally fit for all aspects of your life (work, home and social!).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set working hours into your Google Calendar / company calendar. This tells your colleagues and anyone else that you won&#8217;t be contactable outside of what hours you set, so it automatically declines meetings, and can send auto-replies to emails. This helps manage external expectations and can decrease pressure for you to constantly be near your work device in case something comes in. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Switching off after a hard day/week at work can be a challenge. I recommend pre-planning an activity to take your mind off of it. Arrange to see friends, plan a favourite recipe to cook, queue up a new Netflix series. It&#8217;s so important to get a break from the working mindset, otherwise burnout and stress becomes a real possibility. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Elsbeth Russell &#8211; Community Manager</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Change up your environment. Having zero commute is amazing but let’s face it,  sometimes working where you live can get a little mundane. I find it helps to mix things up sometimes for a change of scenery. If it’s nice outside I may sit out on my back porch and work for a bit. Is there a meeting you can take as a call and take a walk while you chat? Maybe you can work from your local coffee shop for a couple of hours.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a brain break. When my mind has been going a mile a minute all day, I find it helpful to do something that requires very minimal thinking as I wrap up the day. Something like zoning out while cutting up veggies for dinner prep or taking the dog for a walk around the block helps to give my brain a break and helps me to recharge. (As a plus, often I’ll end up thinking up some of my favorite ideas when I’m not even trying.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surround yourself with things you love. I find that I work much better when I’m in a place that makes me feel happy. I try to curate my space with items that inspire me. These may include a favorite piece of art or picture on the wall, a bright plant or fresh cut flowers, or even my favorite scented candle. It doesn’t always happen with kids running around the house, but it also helps when I can pick up clutter and focus in a clean and calming environment. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what you may be doing, remember to take a deep breath and know that it is all going to be okay. Think about what your three tips would be to find a good balance and when you are having a hard day, look back at them. </span></p>

(You can still catch the current version <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/resources/white-papers-guides/email-in-2021/?src=Blog&amp;pc=bl-2021-benchmark-report&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=sp-website&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=">here</a>.) Much of that data comes from SparkPost’s permissioned panel and off the massive footprint of sending 4-5 trillion emails per year. To get a sense of that volume, check out this video that shows what $trillion is on a scale that the mind can comprehend. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mind is blown that we send 4-5 times that much in email each year! Currently, that’s around 40% of the world’s commercial email volume. That’s a lot of email data exhaust that we’ll share when our new report comes out in January 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s missing from our data, though? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right. You! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t just want our report to show email benchmarks, we want to take a pulse on your workload, how you value email, what concerns you have about your job, etc. We know email is a really challenging and complex channel to manage, and we want to incorporate your voice into our report. All of you in the email community made those 4-5 trillion sends happen after all! How are YOU feeling? That’s where SparkPost’s 2021 Global Email Marketing Practitioners Survey comes in!</span></p>

And those emails often contain a lot of information about the products and services being provided – so how can you use that information through email competitive intelligence tracking to help your own business?</p>
<h2>What <em>is</em> email competitive intelligence tracking?</h2>
<p>Email competitive intelligence tracking is looking at what your competitors are doing in order to engage with their customers. The key benefit of tracking your competitors (specifically in the inbox) is learning from their successes and mistakes and using that information to optimize your own marketing programs.</p>
<p>Not only can you see examples of their products and pricing, but you can also gain insight into how successful their email campaigns are in driving customer engagement – what subject lines work best, what cadence do they normally stick to, what’s getting the most clicks?</p>
<h2>How can you gather data from your competitors’ emails?</h2>
<p>First, you could just sign yourself up to all your competitors’ email lists, and then go through the emails manually… However, this is time consuming and can only give you an <strong><em>idea</em></strong> on their products and services and nothing about how they structure their email campaigns.</p>
<p>What you really want is to be able to look at data gathered from multiple sources, which can give you an idea of how a competitor is actually running their campaigns.</p>
<p>Systems designed for this specific function use a few different methods to gather email competitive intelligence:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are tools that can use data provided directly by a customer’s mailbox.</li>
<li>They also use seedlists to sign up to emails.</li>
<li>Complex algorithms can analyze the data and fill in the gaps.</li>
</ul>
<h2>So, what can you track &amp; how can you leverage the data?</h2>
<p>Email competitive intelligence tracking helps you monitor things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Campaign volumes &amp; frequencies</li>
<li>Customer engagement</li>
<li>Campaign segmentation</li>
<li>Subject lines</li>
<li>Email design</li>
<li>Competitor overlap</li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/10/prweb13778008.htm">The Relevancy Group</a>, “companies using competitive intelligence applications generate <strong>3x more</strong> <strong>revenue</strong> than those that don’t!” So, let’s drill into some of these areas and dig into how you can leverage the insights from email competitive intelligence.</p>
<h3>1. How large are your competitors’ mailable audiences?</h3>
<p>This stat will reveal the number of potential customer impressions your competition has in their database. This can expose whether you may be underperforming in relation to a comparable size and market footprint.</p>
<p>With this insight, you can perform your own contact acquisition and list health audit to discover audience development and retention opportunities.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-62463 size-large" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Estimated-List-Size-Table.png?w=1024" alt="A table showing estimated list size for an email sender" width="1024" height="218" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Estimated-List-Size-Table.png 1964w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Estimated-List-Size-Table.png?resize=300,64 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Estimated-List-Size-Table.png?resize=768,163 768w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Estimated-List-Size-Table.png?resize=1024,218 1024w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Estimated-List-Size-Table.png?resize=1536,327 1536w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Estimated-List-Size-Table.png?resize=1200,255 1200w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Estimated-List-Size-Table.png?resize=100,21 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3>2. How often and when do they send campaigns?</h3>
<p>Understanding others’ send cadences can feed your team critical knowledge about the extent, nature, and timing of competitive email programming. This can identify strategy and program gaps and opportunities.</p>
<p>You may schedule your own email event and campaign planning around this information, and it will likely inspire time-of-day and day-of-week testing and optimization.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-62466 size-large" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sends-Per-Day-Graphic.png?w=978" alt="A graphic showing how often and when an email sender sends campaigns" width="978" height="362" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sends-Per-Day-Graphic.png 978w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sends-Per-Day-Graphic.png?resize=300,111 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sends-Per-Day-Graphic.png?resize=768,284 768w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sends-Per-Day-Graphic.png?resize=100,37 100w" sizes="(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px" /></p>
<h3>3. How often does a campaign touch the customer?</h3>
<p>How often do you email a single contact within a given week? Insight into how your peers handle this will empower you to build competitive contact strategies. Emailing a subscriber too frequently creates retention risk, but communication that&#8217;s too infrequent suggests an opportunity for increased contact.</p>
<p>Competitor benchmarking is helpful for contact frequency testing and optimization.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-62468 size-large" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Weekly-Contact-Frequency-Table.png?w=1024" alt="A table showing an example of an email sender's weekly contact frequency." width="1024" height="220" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Weekly-Contact-Frequency-Table.png 1970w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Weekly-Contact-Frequency-Table.png?resize=300,65 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Weekly-Contact-Frequency-Table.png?resize=768,165 768w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Weekly-Contact-Frequency-Table.png?resize=1024,220 1024w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Weekly-Contact-Frequency-Table.png?resize=1536,331 1536w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Weekly-Contact-Frequency-Table.png?resize=1200,258 1200w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Weekly-Contact-Frequency-Table.png?resize=100,22 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3>4. What is the average email list size per campaign?</h3>
<p>Are their campaigns targeted for customers? Understanding this data will feed your team critical knowledge about a competitor’s campaign reach. It suggests their degree of sophistication in audience selection. How are they segmenting their database per campaign? I.e. How targeted and personalized are they getting per send? Do they have a relatively large number of deployed campaigns versus relatively small overall send volumes?</p>
<p>This insight can in turn inform your own event and campaign planning to ensure your targeting strategies are up to par. Enhanced sophistication in segmentation and targeting can give you a big leg up against competitors.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-62464 size-large" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/List-Size-Table.png?w=1024" alt="A sample table showing an email sender's list size." width="1024" height="387" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/List-Size-Table.png 1974w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/List-Size-Table.png?resize=300,113 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/List-Size-Table.png?resize=768,290 768w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/List-Size-Table.png?resize=1024,387 1024w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/List-Size-Table.png?resize=1536,580 1536w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/List-Size-Table.png?resize=1200,453 1200w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/List-Size-Table.png?resize=100,38 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3>5. How are their read/open rates compared to yours?</h3>
<p>It’s always critical to know when and to what extent your competitors are doing anything better than you are. If your competitors have significantly better email engagement from their audience – that’s something to be concerned about.</p>
<p>But never fear. Insight into their programs can help you document the business upside to audience and message optimization, so you can improve your own program and audience planning. You may glean some best practices from their campaigns so you can better diagnose your emails and set some benchmark goals.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-62465 size-large" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Rate-Table.png?w=1024" alt="A sample table showing an email sender's read rate." width="1024" height="197" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Rate-Table.png 1954w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Rate-Table.png?resize=300,58 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Rate-Table.png?resize=768,148 768w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Rate-Table.png?resize=1024,197 1024w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Rate-Table.png?resize=1536,296 1536w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Rate-Table.png?resize=1200,231 1200w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Rate-Table.png?resize=100,19 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h3>6. How many of their customers are also yours?</h3>
<p>This data reveals which other brands are competing with you for attention in your customers&#8217; inboxes – because we all know the battle in the inbox can be fierce.</p>
<p>This will help you calibrate your mailings to match (or surpass) the quality and sophistication of key competitive mailers. You can also leverage list overlaps for new audience acquisition and engagement.</p>
<h3>7. How are their subject lines structured?</h3>
<p>A good subject line is absolutely crucial. Before you can get a conversion, you first must pique someone’s interest to open your mail. The wording, length, and symbols used can impact engagement.</p>
<p>Quantitative data as well as insight into competitors’ actual subject lines will inspire your own subject-line testing so you can be on your email A-game.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-62467 size-large" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Subject-Lines-Graphic.png?w=979" alt="An example table showing an email sender's subject line data." width="979" height="96" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Subject-Lines-Graphic.png 979w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Subject-Lines-Graphic.png?resize=300,29 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Subject-Lines-Graphic.png?resize=768,75 768w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Subject-Lines-Graphic.png?resize=100,10 100w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px" /></p>
<h2>How else can email competitive intelligence add value to your marketing programs?</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you have likely heard (and may be stressing about), Apple really rocked the email world when they announced in June that they were planning to anonymize open activity for their email users. Shortly after the announcement, we published a comprehensive </span><a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/impact-of-ios-15-update-on-open-tracking/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about what these changes mean. We also wrote about some of the </span><a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/4-insights-on-ios-15-mail-privacy-protection/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lesser understood impacts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Lastly, we did an </span><a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/resources/videos/ask-us-anything-what-the-ios-15-changes-mean-for-email/?src=Blog&amp;pc=bl-wc-ios15-email-changes&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=sp-website&amp;utm_campaign=WBN-2021-07-22-iOS15-Changes&amp;utm_content=ios-blog-banner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ask Me Anything” webinar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to answer a lot of questions from the email community. We also promised to give an update on what we’re doing from a product standpoint to prepare for these changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Inbox Tracker and Competitive Tracker products don’t use open pixels to track opens, so those will continue to work as they always have. On the sending side, we have recently added a field to both Signals Webhooks and the Events API to indicate when an open has been pre-fetched. These opens will still be included since they can be a valuable signal that an email address is valid. (Specifically, they indicate that the email address is linked to a powered-on Apple device, so it’s almost certainly associated with a “real” human being.) Nevertheless, the new flag will make it easy to see that these opens are different from actual engagement events and should be treated differently.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up, we’ll be adding the ability to distinguish prefetched and proxy opens in our Analytics Report UI and Metrics API. SparkPost is dedicated to continued innovation of our solutions to better serve email professionals who need better insight into the true performance of your email program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve reached out to some of you to get feedback on how to accommodate Apple’s changes, and we’re listening. If you are a SparkPost customer and you want to be a part of the feedback on these releases, please contact your account team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know change can be scary, but adapting is a part of life. We hope that we have been able to make this change a bit easier and less intimidating to navigate. Good luck, and we’ll see you on the other side!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a while since we’ve provided an update on email benchmark trends in light of the pandemic and the ever-evolving situation that has unfolded over the last 16 months. We like to check in periodically to keep tabs on what is happening when it comes to send volume (grey background), inbox rates (red line) and read rates (blue line) by different verticals and specific niches within those verticals. All data within this update has been pulled from our </span><a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/accuracy-of-sparkpost-panel-data/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly accurate permissioned panel data. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with retail where we see online and apparel with a moderate, steady increase in volume outside of holiday 2020, where there was an expected sharp peak. Inbox rates have been steady for both and read rate has declined at an equal and opposite reflection of volume and inbox rate increase. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-62373 size-full" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-1.png" alt="Pandemic Benchmarks 1" width="512" height="162" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-1.png 512w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-1.png?resize=300,95 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-1.png?resize=100,32 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62372" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-2.png" alt="Pandemic Benchmarks 2" width="512" height="163" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-2.png 512w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-2.png?resize=300,96 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-2.png?resize=100,32 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to uncategorized retail, volumes have fluctuated wildly with a trend toward an increase since the start of the pandemic. Inbox rates have remained quite steady given the volume fluctuations and read rates have slightly declined over the 16-month period. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62374" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-3.png" alt="Pandemic Benchmarks 3" width="512" height="163" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-3.png 512w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-3.png?resize=300,96 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-3.png?resize=100,32 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supermarket and drug industry has had the most drastic change among retail since the beginning of the pandemic, which is no surprise. Many people are moving toward digital engagement by ordering groceries and personal care items online and doing click-and-collect or having the items delivered. This results in emails surrounding the transactions that didn’t take place at such a high level prior to the pandemic, but also more personalized promotional communications by retailers understanding shopping habits. There’s been a steep increase in volume, steady inboxing and a slightly declined read rate. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62375" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-4.png" alt="Pandemic Benchmarks 4" width="512" height="163" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-4.png 512w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-4.png?resize=300,96 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-4.png?resize=100,32 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Media and publishing has experienced some interesting changes since March 2020. There was a dramatic spike in volume toward the first few months of the pandemic with volumes moderately declining after the initial spike. It’s no surprise volumes were high earlier in the pandemic, as breaking news and information was being shared on a near-constant basis. There’s been a steady decline in volume since that initial spike with a strong and steady increase in inbox rates and a fairly level amount of engagement over the 16 months in the way of read rate. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62376" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-5.png" alt="Pandemic Benchmarks 5" width="512" height="161" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-5.png 512w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-5.png?resize=300,94 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-5.png?resize=100,31 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical volume was fairly high throughout most of 2021 with a steady decline since the beginning of 2021. Inbox rates have been fairly steady with a marked dip in early 2021, and read rates have been steady since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 through mid-summer. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62377" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-6.png" alt="Pandemic Benchmarks 6" width="512" height="161" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-6.png 512w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-6.png?resize=300,94 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-6.png?resize=100,31 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social and review companies had very high volume at the beginning of the pandemic with a moderate, steady decline since. Inboxing has improved with the decline in volume, and read rates have been steady since the beginning of the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62378" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-7.png" alt="Pandemic Benchmarks 7" width="512" height="162" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-7.png 512w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-7.png?resize=300,95 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-7.png?resize=100,32 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Telco we’ve seen wild fluctuations of volume at times with an overall steady increase in email volume if we look at it across the entire 16-month period. Inboxing increased into summer 2020 and has steadily declined since the fall of 2020. Read rates have moderately and steadily declined since the beginning of the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62379" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-8.png" alt="Pandemic Benchmarks 8" width="512" height="161" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-8.png 512w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-8.png?resize=300,94 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-8.png?resize=100,31 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel has been impacted heavily by the pandemic. Volumes decreased sharply early in the pandemic and have yet to completely rebound to pre-pandemic levels. Inbox rates have been steady with a very slight decline in read rates as volumes have started their rebound. Even with the seeming rebound of the travel industry this summer, volumes didn’t line up with pre-pandemic levels. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62380" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-9.png" alt="Pandemic Benchmarks 9" width="512" height="163" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-9.png 512w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-9.png?resize=300,96 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-9.png?resize=100,32 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automotive has been remarkably stable throughout the pandemic in terms of volume, inbox rate and read rate. We did see a sharp spike in December, but that is expected given the seasonality of the holidays. (A lot of lucky people get automobiles as gifts or year end or spend for business tax write-off purposes.) The automotive industry has been hit hard with supply chain issues, but email seems to be relatively stable even with all the challenges since the beginning of the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62381" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-10.png" alt="Pandemic Benchmarks 10" width="512" height="163" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-10.png 512w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-10.png?resize=300,96 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-10.png?resize=100,32 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s had some steep dips and spikes a few times over the 16-month period, B2B volumes have been relatively stable, with only a slight decline. Inboxing and engagement have slightly declined. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62382" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-11.png" alt="Pandemic Benchmarks 11" width="512" height="161" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-11.png 512w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-11.png?resize=300,94 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-11.png?resize=100,31 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entertainment has trended down nearly 20% since the beginning of the pandemic, which is no surprise, as this category comprises businesses like theaters. With the downward trend in volume, we’ve seen better inbox rates and read rates being fairly flat despite the volume and inbox rate fluctuations. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62383" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-12.png" alt="Pandemic Benchmarks 12" width="512" height="163" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-12.png 512w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-12.png?resize=300,96 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-12.png?resize=100,32 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Finance, volumes were steadily high for the first six months given all the economic changes. It has since declined, but leveled off to be slightly lower than the early days of the pandemic. Inbox rates have slightly improved with the slight decline in volume and read rates have been fairly stable the entire time. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62384" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-13.png" alt="Pandemic Benchmarks 13" width="512" height="161" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-13.png 512w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-13.png?resize=300,94 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-13.png?resize=100,31 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volume for Food and Beverage was up earlier in the pandemic as delivery services took off and dining transactions happened digitally. That has tapered off since the beginning of 2021 as many people returned to restaurants into the summer. Inbox and read rates have been mostly stable even as the volume has changed. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62385" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-14.png" alt="Pandemic Benchmarks 14" width="512" height="163" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-14.png 512w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-14.png?resize=300,96 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-14.png?resize=100,32 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, Government, Education and Charities slightly trended upward until Q4 2020, where they had a sharp spike due to seasonality. Many people make donations around the holidays and to get tax benefits for the following year. In the US, the election cycle impacted volume in this category as well. Inbox rates have slightly improved, and read rates have slightly declined. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62386" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-15.png" alt="Pandemic Benchmarks 15" width="512" height="161" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-15.png 512w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-15.png?resize=300,94 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pandemic-Benchmarks-15.png?resize=100,31 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will continue to monitor the evolution of email as we continue to navigate through the pandemic. With the delta variant spiking in various parts of the world and winter ahead, we will likely see more fluctuations in certain categories. We’ll be sure to keep you posted on what’s happening with email as a result. </span></p>

<p><b>SparkPost Intern:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A student who bestows the best opportunity to build their resumé, work and learn from incredible colleagues, make a difference within a company, collaborate across the company, and have a blast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Covid-19 and how that has upended many companies, SparkPost offered remote internship opportunities. The chance for a remote internship (or any at all) was quite slim, and </span>there were few opportunities to pick from. SparkPost hired seven interns that worked in various departments – marketing, engineering, data science etc. We interns have not only learned and spoken to almost every team leader in SparkPost, but we have also learned from one another.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting out as “the summer intern” may sound intimidating to most, but the open arms and supportive employees here have made me and the other interns feel so comfortable to collaborate in team meetings and voice our opinions. </span></p>
<h3>My Experience as a Marketing Intern</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Lauren Stein, and I’m a rising junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This summer, I’ve been the Social Media and Content Intern in the marketing department. The marketing team contains mentors and professionals that inspire me to work harder every day. Each meeting, the marketing team makes sure I am in the loop and comfortable about my everyday tasks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From day one I was encouraged to engage with the team and share my thoughts. My team consistently challenged me and pushed me to learn more and do better. Throughout this internship, I’ve learned copious amounts of new skills – from running social media accounts, to editing and publishing blogs, to creating a competitive intelligence project that compares and contrasts SparkPost to our competitors.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When thinking about what makes SparkPost unique and such an incredible company, I think of the people first. Every individual I have spoken to has helped me grow personally and professionally. I could not think of a better place to have an internship because in just a short few months, I have learned information that will aid me in my future endeavors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure</span>, I&#8217;m the social media intern, and part of my gig is writing blogs, but check out what some of my fellow interns also had to say about their experience!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Lucy Sanchez-Sandoval – Software Engineer Intern:</strong> “What I love about my internship at SparkPost is the way that my team and manager have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">redefined failure for me. Every develo</span>per on the team has reassured me that they have struggled at some point in their early career. However, through their proactiveness, they have revealed that what counts is how we react to failure. They consistently challenge me to do better and be better, while still making sure to validate my work and progress. I just love coming into work and feeling like I am making an impact on products and customers in a positive way and that my voice is valued throughout these changes.”</p>

<h3>So, What’s Next? TBD!</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After talking with the other interns, we would not change this opportunity for the world. We were lucky enough to have the most supportive mentors, feel like true team members, and now we are ready to tackle the world. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="360" height="370" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Panel-Data-Accuracy-360x370-1.png" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="SparkPost Panel Data" loading="lazy" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Panel-Data-Accuracy-360x370-1.png 360w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Panel-Data-Accuracy-360x370-1.png?resize=292,300 292w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Panel-Data-Accuracy-360x370-1.png?resize=97,100 97w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the questions we regularly receive about our Permissioned Email Panel is how accurate it is in terms of forecasting inbox rates. Historically, this has been a difficult question to answer with any authority as there was no source of ground truth to measure against, and so opinions (and general faith in sample statistics) ruled the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, though, with a major mailbox provider licensing inbox placement data for their platform, it’s possible to do a real analysis, which we did over some 20,000 distinct sending domains of senders large and small, both on our sending platform and on other providers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results are exciting. The permissioned panel is highly accurate, even with relatively low signal, and gets extremely accurate as the number of distinct panelists seen in a send is increased. Using common statistical methods, we look at the root mean square error (RMSE &#8211; an analogue of the standard deviation) between the inboxing rate as seen at the major provider with what our panel sees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our analysis, we noted that senders who send their mail through top email service providers see a materially better correlation between the panel inbox rate and true inbox rate. The mechanism for this isn’t known, but we postulate that the compliance standards that large service providers hold their customers to generally result in more consistent inboxing rates across their audience and so are less prone to skew. We can see this if we restrict our plot to senders only on top ESPs, which also reduces the RMSE by about 30%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when a small number (10) of daily panelists see the mail stream, we see a very strong correlation between the inbox rate as seen by the panel and the ground truth:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-62314 size-full" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Panel-Data-1.png" alt="SparkPost Panel Data" width="434" height="377" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Panel-Data-1.png 434w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Panel-Data-1.png?resize=300,261 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Panel-Data-1.png?resize=100,87 100w" sizes="(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we consider only streams where 50 or more panelists are seen daily, the correlation becomes even tighter:</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-62315 size-full" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Panel-Data-2.png" alt="SparkPost Panel Data" width="426" height="377" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Panel-Data-2.png 426w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Panel-Data-2.png?resize=300,265 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Panel-Data-2.png?resize=100,88 100w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we look at how this error rate varies over time, we see a few things: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even at extremely small numbers of unique panelists receiving the mail, the error rate is under 10%.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It quickly drops to 4% as the number of panelists increases.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It eventually approaches 2% – showing that <strong>panel data is 98% accurate. </strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the purposes of identifying mail stream deliverability issues, this accuracy is fantastic.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-62316 size-full" src="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Panel-Data-3.png" alt="SparkPost Panel Data" width="512" height="297" srcset="https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Panel-Data-3.png 512w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Panel-Data-3.png?resize=300,174 300w, https://www.sparkpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Panel-Data-3.png?resize=100,58 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you might ask: with a major provider offering ground truth numbers, what’s the utility of having panel data as well, even if it is highly correlated? The majority of mailbox providers – including titans like Google and Microsoft – do not offer inbox placement data, and so for messages delivered there, you still need a source like panel data to understand inboxing rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now we can all be confident in its accuracy for those cases.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no doubt the iOS 15 Mail Privacy Protection changes are significant and will have a direct impact on how marketers track the success of their email programs. When faced with such a drastic and sudden change, it’s only natural to try and seek out ways that will keep or rationalize the status quo.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are four insights on the more nuanced and not immediately obvious impacts of the iOS 15 changes.</span><b></b></p>
<h3><b>1. The Impact Goes Beyond iCloud.com Email Accounts</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mail Privacy Protection will impact </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> email account that is set up within the Apple Mail.app in iOS 15, iPadOS 15, or MacOS Monterey. Generally, </span><b>we expect this to impact 30-40% of a recipient’s user list.  </b><b></b></p>
<h3><b>2. Users Don’t Need to Actively Use Mail.App for Email to be Impacted by Mail Privacy Protection</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s consider a common scenario: a user sets up their email account in Apple Mail.app, Gmail’s App, and also routinely makes use of the Gmail Web App. Even if the user rarely (or never) opens their email in Apple Mail.app, Mail Privacy Protection will still pre-load images because the email account was set up in Apple’s Mail.app. In this case, a sender will see opens from Apple’s image proxy </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gmail’s image proxy.  </span></p>
<h3><b>3. Regularly Monitor for Changes to the User-Agent String</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per</span> <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/multidevice/user-agent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a browser&#8217;s user-agent string helps identify which browser is being used, what version, and on which operating system. Currently, the user-agent string that Apple’s proxy servers are sending when requesting images is Mozilla/5.0. While there is no direct indication that this belongs to Apple’s image proxies, our testing indicates that the string </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">does</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accurately identify requests coming from Apple’s image proxies. This, in turn, may allow senders to filter out Apple proxy opens from their metrics or segment them differently. It is unknown whether Apple will change this in the future. As such, it will be important for senders to monitor for changes to this string and to adjust accordingly.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. Do Not Depend On Technical Hacks or Workarounds</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">History has shown us that any technical workarounds to bypassing privacy-related functionality are often short-lived, harms your reputation, and are quickly closed. Even though early testing indicates there are some workarounds to Apple’s preloading of images, we believe </span><b>senders should not rely upon or use these workarounds.  </b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following Mail Privacy Protection limitations have been observed in early beta testing:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Preloading primarily happens when the user is on wifi and when plugged in.<br />
</strong></em>Early testing indicates that preloading only happens when the user is on wifi and their phone is plugged into power. This behavior is a little unexpected and will be interesting to observe as Apple moves to General Availability for iOS15. In practice, what this means is that the open events are even more random than initially thought. It seems open events can occur when the user actually opens the message, or when the user hasn’t opened the message but is on wifi and the phone is charging – or some other combination of events that Apple decides. All of this points to the same conclusion: open tracking on Apple devices can’t be trusted.</li>
<li><em><em><strong>User-initiated open events are triggered when the image is loaded via external CSS.<br />
</strong></em></em>Testing also indicates that user-initiated open events are triggered when the image is loaded via an external CSS file. While on the surface this might seem like good news, <b>we strongly recommend against using this approach</b>. It’s extremely likely that Apple, like HEY already did, will close this loophole. <em><a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1248723555832848384?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(Read the Twitter thread.)</a></em></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is a more fundamental reason not to use this approach: users who have opted into Mail Privacy Protection have explicitly said they do not want providers tracking them via email opens. Using these sort of workarounds betrays that user trust, is bad-practice, and ultimately harms your brand’s reputation.</span><b><i></i></b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to remember that the ultimate goal was never about tracking opens – but instead to reach our target audience by sending emails that recipients want to engage with. As long as senders keep that as their north star, we’ll all adapt together to find new user and privacy-centric ways to measure the results.</span></p>
